# Portfolio-assignment

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to show investing and the power of compound interest.

What did you do particularly well?
I showed great naming conventions for my code and the skill for anyone to understand what the code is computing.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I don't think there is any where in my code to improve upon from my code because it covers all the reqiurments, also with making the code itself easy to read for people to see excatly what is being called in funtions of the project. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I came across a little problem when setting yearEndInt += to the calculations of interest. I found that I couldnt use the += operator unless I had curly braces next to yearEndInt before entering in calculations for interest. This took me hours but the way I found out it was a problem was going back the book and reading what curly braces can do next to a variable,  which is determining its size and layout of varible's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to that varible. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Making the menu was a great chance to know how to add a more graphic design of a menu. The menu will help me be more creative in what the user sees on a menu instead of just a plain old boring menu. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The naming conventions say it all, I think anyone can read my code and see what it does and computes first from what the user enters in the prompt. The calculations make this code maintainable by setting a standard to what the user can enter as valid and invalid. Also setting a limit to the highest number the user can enter. This code is adaptable by the exact number you enter weather that be $20 or $20.49 can be understood by the machine.
